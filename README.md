# kemal-playground

A sandbox app to play around with Kemal. Two autocomplete fields have been implemented - one that uses AJAX and another that uses WebSockets.

## Installation

1. [Install Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/)
2. Run the following commands
```bash
$ shards install
$ crystal build --release src/kemal-playground.cr # Omit the release flag for faster non-optimized builds
$ ./kemal-playground
[development] Kemal is ready to lead at http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

## Usage

1. Visit `localhost:3000`
2. Be impressed with Kemal's sub 100Âµs response times

No further development is planned beyond adhoc features being added. Feel free to fork if you want a starting point with Kemal.
